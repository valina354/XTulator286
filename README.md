# Fork of XTulator attempting 286 compatibility

# Progress

287 FPU unit
Basic protected mode emulation (Unable to start any operating systems yet)
All 286 instructions emulated

# Notes

Cannot post 286 bioses yet (closest one gives A20 line error??)
Cannot run any operating systems yet, seems to be some issue related to interrupts primarily causing triple faults
Games like wolf3d get close to working (Wolf3d can get into mainmenu but triple faults when switching to protected mode)
